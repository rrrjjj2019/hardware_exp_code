2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
LUTAR-1#1 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell V/out_reg[0]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) out_reg[0]/CLR, out_reg[3]/CLR, out_reg[4]/CLR, out_reg[5]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#2 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell V/out_reg[1]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) out_reg[1]/CLR. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
Related violations: <none>

LUTAR-1#3 Warning
LUT drives async reset alert  
LUT cell V/out_reg[2]_i_3, with 2 or more inputs, drives asynchronous preset/clear pin(s) out_reg[2]/CLR, out_reg[6]/PRE. The LUT may glitch and trigger an unexpected reset, even if it is a properly timed path.
