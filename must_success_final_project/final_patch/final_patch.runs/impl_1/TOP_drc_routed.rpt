2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net I_BAUDGEN/stop_bit_reg is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin I_BAUDGEN/Tx_i_3/O, cell I_BAUDGEN/Tx_i_3. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#2 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net I_RS232RX/E[0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin I_RS232RX/next_count_back_reg[27]_i_2/O, cell I_RS232RX/next_count_back_reg[27]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#3 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net I_RS232RX/FSM_sequential_present_state_reg[0]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin I_RS232RX/motor_en_reg_i_2/O, cell I_RS232RX/motor_en_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#4 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net I_RS232RX/FSM_sequential_present_state_reg[2]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin I_RS232RX/motor_dir2_reg_i_2/O, cell I_RS232RX/motor_dir2_reg_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#5 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net I_RS232RX/state_reg[1][0] is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin I_RS232RX/next_state_reg[1]_i_2/O, cell I_RS232RX/next_state_reg[1]_i_2. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PDRC-153#6 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net motor_dir_reg/G0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin motor_dir_reg/L3_2/O, cell motor_dir_reg/L3_2 (in motor_dir_reg macro). This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
Related violations: <none>

PLHOLDVIO-2#1 Warning
Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations  
A LUT I_BAUDGEN/Tx_i_3 is driving clock pin of 12 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. First few involved cells are:
    I_RS232TX/Bit_reg[0] {FDRE}
    I_RS232TX/Bit_reg[1] {FDRE}
    I_RS232TX/Bit_reg[2] {FDRE}
    I_RS232TX/Bit_reg[3] {FDRE}
    I_RS232TX/TxDone_reg {FDRE}
    I_RS232TX/Tx_reg {FDSE}
    I_RS232TX/counter_reg[0] {FDRE}
    I_RS232TX/counter_reg[1] {FDRE}
    I_RS232TX/counter_reg[2] {FDRE}

Related violations: <none>
